#### By **Victor Maina**
## Description
Quotes app is a simple Angular web app that displays quotes from famous people. The app is divided into two sides. On the left, there is a list of quotes that have already been added. On the right, there is a form where a user can add their own quotes. Users can also upvote and downvote quotes depending on what they deem inspiring. The quote with the highest number of upvotes is highlighted in yellow.
## Setup/Installation Requirements

If you would like to run the app locally on your Ubuntu machine, then first install Node Package Manager, preferably through [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Then install [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) on your machine. All the necessary installation info is in the Angular documentation.

Once angular-cli is setup, open terminal and do:
```
$ ng serve
```
With this command, Angular will compile the app open a local serve on your computer. Open your browser and enter `http://localhost:4200`.


## Known Bugs
There are a few issues with mobile responsiveness in the app. On some devices, the input form won't show.
